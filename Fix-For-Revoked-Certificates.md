If you suddenly can't open Spike anymore it means Apple has revoked the Enterprise Certificate associated with the app. Expect this to happen a few of times a year.

The following guide will get you up and running again in less than 5 minutes. 

## Backup Current Data & Settings

Please follow the appropriate steps depending on your iOS version. If by any chance you're on iOS 11 or above and you can't find the Spike database then just follow instructions for iOS 10 or below.

### iOS 11 or above 

Open the Files app on your device home screen.

Go to the "On My iPhone" section.

Open the Spike folder. DO NOT TRY TO OPEN THE DATABASE! If you open the database and end up deleting all your data just open Spike App Center, go to Settings > Maintenance > iCloud and press "Restore". After the restore process is done you should have recovered most of your data and you can restart this guide.

## Reinstall Spike

Now that you've backed up all your data, go to your device's home screen and delete (uninstall) Spike completely.

After you've deleted Spike we will reinstall a new version with a new working certificate. Open Safari on your phone, navigate to https://ignition.fun and press the "Use Now (Web)" button. Alternatively, you can press the Ignition Store link on https://spike-app.com home page.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/04.jpg]]

While navigating the Ignition app store, if you see popups just know that they are not real popups, they are ads. Close all ads that might show up and proceed with this guide.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/36.jpg]]

Now press the search tab in the lower right region of the screen

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/33.jpg]]

Search for "Spike".

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/34.jpg]]

If Spike is still not signed just wait a few minutes (up to 1h) and try again when the "Signed" button is visible.

Choose your desired Spike version (iPhone vs iPad) and then press the "Get" button. Note: Only install Spike if Ignition shows you the "Signed" button. 

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/08.jpg]]

Wait for a small popup to appear and then press "Install". You can now close Safari. Spike installation will begin after a few seconds on your home screen.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/09.jpg]]

After the installation is finished, if you try to open Spike you will be shown an error message notifying you that the developer has not yet been verified. 

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/m01.jpg]]

To verify Spike please open your device settings and navigate to the "General" section.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/10.jpg]]

Scroll down and navigate to the "Profiles & Device Management" section.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/11.jpg]]

Under the "Enterprise Apps" section select the newly installed certificate.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/12.jpg]]

Your last step is pressing the "Verify" button. Afterwards you may close your settings and open Spike.

## Restore Your Data & Settings

The last step is restoring all your data and settings to the newly installed Spike. Please follow the appropriate steps depending on your iOS version:

### iOS 11 or above 

Make sure Spike Ignition is installed on your phone and it's completely closed from the app switcher (double click the home button or swipe from the bottom on iPhone X or above and if you see Spike on the list of apps swipe up on it to close it).

Open the Files app once again and go to Locations -> iCloud Drive. Now press the "Select" button.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/24.jpg]]

Select your previously backed up Spike database and press the "Copy" button.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/25.jpg]]

Copy your previously backed up Spike database into your newly installed Spike Ignition (Locations -> On My iPhone -> Spike). If by any chance iOS asks you if you want to overwrite your existing database just press "Yes". You're finished! You can now close the Files app.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/26.jpg]]

Note: If by any change, after you open Spike your transmitter does not automatically connect please go to Spike's main menu > transmitter, press forget and then press scan. If that doesn't work, try to turn your Bluetooth off and on. Users that don't have the scan/forget button just restart your phone and all should start working again.

### iOS 10 or below 

Make sure Spike Ignition is installed on your phone and it's completely closed from the app switcher (double click the home button or swipe from the bottom on iPhone X or above and if you see Spike on the list of apps swipe up on it to close it).

Connect your iOS device to your computer using an USB cable, open iTunes and once again head over to the "File Sharing" section.

Select Spike from the list and press the "Add" button.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/30.jpg]]

Navigate to the folder where you previously saved your Spike database, select it and add it to your newly installed Spike.

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/31.jpg]]

If by any chance iTunes asks you if you want to overwrite your existing database, press "Replace".

[[https://spike-app.com/wiki/images/ignition/migration/32.jpg]]

You can now close iTunes.

Note: If by any change, after you open Spike your transmitter does not automatically connect please go to Spike's main menu > transmitter, press forget and then press scan. If that doesn't work, try to turn your Bluetooth off and on. Users that don't have the scan/forget button just restart your phone and all should start working again.

### Soft Reset Your Device

This step is optional but HIGHLY recommended to ensure the migration goes slowly.

After completing all the steps above do a soft-reset on your device to restart iOS.

For all iPhone models below the 7 (not included) just press and hold the power and home buttons at the same time and keep them pressed until your phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release both buttons. For iPhone 7, press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time and keep them pressed until your phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release both buttons. For iPhone 8/X/Xs/XsMax/Xr, briefly press and release the volume up button, then immediately press and release the volume down button, and then press and hold the power button until the phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release the power button.

### Troubleshooting Dexcom/BluCon Nightrider

If your newly installed Spike is losing connection to your Dexcom transmitter then try this:

1) Go to iOS settings -> Bluetooth press the (i) icon next to your Dexcom transmitter and press forget.

2) Soft reset your phone. For all iPhone models below the 7 (not included) just press and hold the power and home buttons at the same time and keep them pressed until your phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release both buttons. For iPhone 7, press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time and keep them pressed until your phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release both buttons. For iPhone 8/X/Xs/XsMax/Xr, briefly press and release the volume up button, then immediately press and release the volume down button, and then press and hold the power button until the phone reboots and you see the Apple logo. As soon as the logo appears you can release the power button.

3) Open Spike, go to the "three dots" menu and press "No Lock".

4) Keep Spike open without locking your device or navigating to another app. Leave Spike in the foreground.

5) A few minutes afterwards you'll get a new pairing request. Accept it (be fast, it only appears for a few seconds)

The Bluetooth connection should improve afterwards...
