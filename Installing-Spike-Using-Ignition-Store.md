## IMPORTANT NOTE!

**After you've been using Spike for a while, if you suddenly can't open the app anymore, it means Apple has revoked the certificate. To fix this just follow this [guide](https://github.com/SpikeApp/Spike/wiki/Fix-For-Revoked-Certificates) (takes less than 5 minutes to be up and running again).**

## Installing Spike

Open Safari on your phone, navigate to https://ignition.fun and press the "Use Now (Web)" button. Alternatively, you can press the Ignition Store link on https://spike-app.com home page.

While navigating the Ignition app store, if you see popups just know that they are not real popups, they are ads. Close all ads that might show up and proceed with this guide.
